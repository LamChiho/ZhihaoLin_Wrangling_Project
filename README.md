If set in the working directory, I believe both rmarkdown or app should be able to work. The original data was the API data and the attacks.csv. Download these two dataset and the rmarkdown then run the rmarkdown, should be able to generate the rest three documents, then the shiny app is able to run.
If want to use shiny apps at the beginning, then please download all dataset. 
For the read_csv, the path of the documents are ~/...csv, so I believe there is no path that can only be found on my computer. 
I have submitted it now but since I also want to use plotly in my shiny app, so I do hope I can upload another shiny app later.
The ggtitles in the shiny app should be self-explainable, but I don't know if the original dataset is well enough. 
The rmarkdown is for data cleaning and the plots tests my assumptions for the shiny apps, and almost every plots shown in rmarkdown were already shown in shiny app, so please try the shiny app if think the plots in original one is not good enough.
